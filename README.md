# Mobile-FTP-download-filter-upload
A Series of batch files that download files from a phone FTP, filter them (correct dir-tree), and upload them to Google Drive

I am  currently trying the script to be a standalone, executable file.
Currently, the following dependencies are required:
* Chocolaty
* LFTP
* 7Zip
* Standalone RCLONE
* Robocopy

Thus, only support for Windows for now
Should work on WINDOWS 10 21H1
