# Mobile-FTP-download-filter-upload
A Series of batch files that download files from a phone FTP, filter them (correct dir-tree), and upload them to Google Drive

Upgraded to WinSCP. Should be completely STANDALONE now.

Should work on WINDOWS 10 21H1

Added universal support, with some tweaking required for WIN-10 machines in Release v-1.1
